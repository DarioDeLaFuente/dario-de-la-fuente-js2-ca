This is a simple overview of the use/purpose of the Course Assignment.

## Description

Level 1 Process
Build a frontend for the API and add the following:

Home page
Make a GET request to fetch a list of resources from your API.
Create HTML for each item and display at least 3 properties for each.
Each item should also display a button or icon. Clicking on this button should toggle the item in and out of an array stored in localStorage.
There should be a text input on this page that filters the array of results on one of the properties.

Favourites page
This page should fetch the array of items stored in localStorage and display them or display a message that there are no items.
There should be a “Clear all” button that clears localStorage (or just a specific key in localStorage) and reloads the display. Don’t reload the page, just redraw the HTML.

This are some bullet points:

- HTML.
- CSS.
- Sass. 
- Js.
